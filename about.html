          <h1>Features of Fifa 22:</h1>

          
            <h2>Hypermotion technology</h2>
            <h5>FIFA 22 introduces "Hypermotion" technology, which uses motion
            capture data collected by having 22 real-life players play a
            complete, high-intensity football match in motion capture suits. The
            data collected from player movements, tackles, aerial duels and
            on-ball actions is later used to power the way both individuals and
            teams move across the pitch in FIFA 22. This feature is only
            available on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Stadia versions
            of the game.</h5>
            <h2>Career mode</h2>

            <h5>As with previous FIFA entries, a single-player "career mode" is
            featured in FIFA 22, where a player can control a whole team or one
            player throughout a 25-year career as a manager or player. FIFA 22
            introduces a create-a-club option in manager career, allowing
            players to design a new club with customised kits, crest, and home
            stadium. The player career mode also introduces experience points
            and "perks" that can be used to improve the player's stats. </h5>
            <h2>Ultimate Team</h2>

        <h5>FIFA 22 Ultimate Team introduced "FUT Heroes" cards and these are
            cards that have a unique league-specific chemistry which is tied to
            their specific hero moment, providing a green club link to any
            player within the same league as well as the usual nation link. The
            full heroes card list includes: Mario Gómez, Tim Cahill, Ole Gunnar
            Solskjær, Jerzy Dudek, Joe Cole, Aleksandr Mostovoi, David Ginola,
            Iván Córdoba, Freddie Ljungberg, Jürgen Kohler, Lars Ricken, Antonio
            Di Natale, Clint Dempsey, Robbie Keane, Abedi Pele, Jorge Campos,
            Fernando Morientes, Sami Al-Jaber and Diego Milito. As in FIFA 21,
            several notable former players are given "icon" cards. New players
            added for this entry include Iker Casillas, Robin van Persie, Wayne
            Rooney and Cafu. Players will also have the option to preview Silver
            and Gold player packs as in the previous game, by allowing players
            to preview what they would receive from a pack before deciding
            whether to purchase it.</h5>
            <h2>VOLTA Football</h2>

        <h5>New VOLTA mechanics in FIFA 22 will allow players to trigger special
            abilities during a match that would boost a player's avatar in a
            specific attribute. There will be three Signature Abilities
            available: Power Strike, Pure Pace and Aggressive Tackle. Players of
            FIFA 22 will also have the opportunity to play with up to three
            players in various online mini game modes, which will be part of the
            new VOLTA Arcade.</h5>
            <h2>Licenses</h2>

        <h5>The game features more than 30 officially licensed leagues, more
            than 700 clubs and more than 17,000 players. For the first time, the
            Indian Super League and its eleven teams were added, as well as the
            UEFA Europa Conference League, the third tier of European club
            football established in 2021. Juventus, Roma, Atalanta and Lazio are
            not featured in FIFA 22 and instead are known as Piemonte Calcio,
            Roma FC, Bergamo Calcio and Latium respectively. The game retains
            the players' likenesses, but the official badge, kits and stadiums
            are unavailable and instead feature custom designs and generic
            stadiums produced by EA Sports. Bayern Munich and Barcelona are also
            featured in the game with licensed players and kits, but do not have
            their stadium licences and play in generic stadiums. Following a
            November 2020 announcement by Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds and
            American actor Rob McElhenney, through the RR McReynolds Company
            LLC, that they would be taking over the club, Wrexham A.F.C were
            included in as part of the "Rest of World" section, becoming the
            first non-league team to be featured in the series. They were last
            in FIFA 07 when they were relegated from League 2 to the National
            League.</h5>
            <h2>Commentators</h2>
        <h5>The English-language version of the game features two new
            commentators. Stewart Robson replaces Lee Dixon as co-commentator to
            Derek Rae, while Alex Scott replaces Alan McInally in the role of
            providing in-game score updates in Career Mode. Scott is the first
            woman commentator in the history of the franchise. </h5>
